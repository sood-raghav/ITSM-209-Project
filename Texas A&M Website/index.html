            In this website we introduce an old aggie tradition, while
            introducing a new one. We also have added pictures and important
            dates about the tradition. Additionally, we have talked about the
            timings of the tradition, why it is important, and when it is
            founded. The website also covers a small biography of each team
            member that worked on the project.
