            In this website we introduce an <b>old aggie tradition</b>,
            <a href="https://www.aggienetwork.com/ring/ringday/" target="_blank"
              >Aggie Ring Day</a
            >, while introducing a new one. We also have added pictures and
            important dates about the tradition. Additionally, we have talked
            about the <u>timings of the tradition</u>, why it is important, and
            <u>when it is founded</u>. The website also covers a small biography
            of each <a href="groupmembers.html"><i>team member</i></a> that
            worked on the project.

                  Our group chose the Aggie Ring tradition because we all plan on getting our Aggie ring. Additionally, it is such a memorable college tradition which makes A&M unique.

                  Our group decided on creating the ETAM banquet tradition as freshman engineering majors work all throughout their freshman year to get the major they want. This event celebrates their hard work and dedication.
